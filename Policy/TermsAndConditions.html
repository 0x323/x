These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the website, application, smart contracts, and related services provided by Lotto Chain.
</p>
<p>
  By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms, which constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User") and Lotto Chain. If you do not agree, please refrain from accessing or using the Platform.

  <li>Sending spam, offensive content, or materials that infringe on third-party rights.</li>
  <li>Attempting to hack, disrupt, or exploit vulnerabilities in the Platform.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Age Restriction</strong>: Users must be at least 18 years old to participate in betting or token-related activities. Users under 18 may only access social features with parental or guardian consent.</p>

<h2>4. User Accounts</h2>
<p>If the Services require an account (e.g., a Web3 wallet or login):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of private keys, passwords, or account credentials.</li>
  <li>Users are responsible for all activity conducted through their account, including blockchain transactions.</li>
  <li>Lotto Chain is not liable for account access loss resulting from user negligence (e.g., losing private keys).</li>
  <li>Users must provide accurate information during registration and promptly notify us of any security breaches.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Ownership and Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
<p>
  All content, source code, design, logos, trademarks, and smart contracts on the Platform are owned by Lotto Chain or its licensors and are protected by international copyright and trademark laws, including the <strong>Berne Convention (1886)</strong> and the <strong>TRIPS Agreement (1994)</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users may not copy, reproduce, modify, or distribute any content without Lotto Chain’s prior written consent.</li>
  <li>The name "Lotto Chain" and related branding elements are trademarks of Lotto Chain, whether registered or not.</li>
  <li>Smart contract code (e.g., on Base Sepolia) is considered protected software under copyright law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. User-Generated Content</h2>
<p>If Users can upload content (e.g., social posts, betting data):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users retain ownership of the content they upload, unless otherwise stated.</li>
  <li>By uploading content, Users grant Lotto Chain a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to display, store, and use the content for operational purposes of the Platform.</li>
  <li>Users are solely responsible for ensuring their content does not violate any laws, third-party rights, or these Terms.</li>
  <li>Lotto Chain reserves the right to remove any content deemed inappropriate or in violation of these Terms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
  The Services are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of accuracy, reliability, or availability. Lotto Chain is not liable for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Financial, data, or other losses resulting from use of the Platform.</li>
  <li>Service interruptions due to technical issues, such as blockchain network failures (e.g., Base Sepolia).</li>
  <li>User errors, such as loss of private keys or incorrect blockchain transactions.</li>
  <li>Content or actions of third parties linked to the Platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lotto Chain's liability is limited to the amount the User paid for the Services, if any.
</p>

<h2>8. Termination of Access</h2>
<p>Lotto Chain reserves the right to suspend or restrict User access to the Platform, with or without notice, if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The User violates these Terms.</li>
  <li>Suspicious, fraudulent, or unlawful activity is detected.</li>
  <li>The User uses the Services in a manner that harms the Platform or others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Termination of access does not affect blockchain transactions already recorded, due to their immutable nature.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>
  Lotto Chain reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Changes become effective immediately upon publication on the Platform. We will endeavor to notify Users of significant changes via email, in-platform notifications, or other appropriate means.
</p>
<p>Continued use of the Platform after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

<h2>10. Refund Policy</h2>
<p>
  Due to the decentralized nature of betting and the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions, Lotto Chain does not offer refunds for confirmed transactions on the blockchain (e.g., bets or token purchases).
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Payments</strong>: Payments for Services (if applicable) are made via tokens or other methods specified on the Platform. All payments are final.</li>
  <li><strong>User Errors</strong>: Lotto Chain is not responsible for losses resulting from user mistakes, such as sending tokens to the wrong address.</li>
  <li><strong>Exceptions</strong>: In limited cases (e.g., platform malfunctions), Lotto Chain may consider refunds based on internal policies and applicable laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
<p>
  These Terms are governed by principles of international law, including the <strong>Berne Convention</strong> and the <strong>TRIPS Agreement</strong>, as well as generally accepted legal frameworks in international jurisdictions. In the event of a dispute, parties agree to attempt resolution through negotiation or mediation first. If unresolved, disputes shall be submitted to international arbitration under the rules of the <strong>International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)</strong>, with arbitration to take place in [specify location, e.g., Singapore].
</p>
<p>
  Due to the decentralized nature of the Platform, blockchain transactions are subject to the laws of the respective network jurisdictions (e.g., Base Sepolia) and are immutable once confirmed.
